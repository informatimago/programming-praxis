;; Nuts And Bolts
;; July 14, 2017
;; Todayâ€™s exercise is an interview question from Microsoft:
;; 
;; You are given two bags, one containing bolts and the other containing
;; nuts, and you need to find the biggest bolt.. You may compare bolts to
;; nuts, to see which is larger, but you may not compare bolts to bolts
;; or nuts to nuts. Write a program to find the biggest bolt.
;; 
;; Your task is to write a program to find the biggest bolt. When you are
;; finished, you are welcome to read or run a suggested solution, or to
;; post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.

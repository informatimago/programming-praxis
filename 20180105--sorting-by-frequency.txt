Sorting By Frequency
January 5, 2018

We have another homework question today, as I continue clearing out my
backlog of people who sent me email asking for homework help last
fall:

You are given an array with duplicates, and are to sort the array by
decreasing frequency of elements. If two elements have the frequency,
sort them in increasing order of value. For instance, the input (2 3 5
3 7 9 5 3 7) is sorted as (3 3 3 5 5 7 7 2 9).

Your task is to write a program that sorts by frequency. When you are
finished, you are welcome to read or run a suggested solution, or to
post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.

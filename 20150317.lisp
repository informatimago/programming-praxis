;; We have another interview question today. There are several different
;; ways to approach this task, so it makes for an interesting exercise:
;; Given three arrays of integers in non-decreasing order, find all
;; integers common to all three arrays. For instance, given arrays
;; [1,5,10,20,40,80], [6,7,10,20,80,100] and [3,4,15,20,30,70,80,120]
;; the two common integers are 20 and 80. If an integer appears multiple
;; times in each of the arrays, it should appear multiple times in the
;; output, so with input arrays [1,5,5,5], [3,4,5,5,10] and [5,5,10,20]
;; the correct output is [5,5]. Your task is to write a program to solve
;; the interview question. When you are finished, you are welcome to
;; read or run a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or
;; discuss the exercise in the comments below.

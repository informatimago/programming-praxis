;; Todayâ€™s exercise helps somebody with their homework: Given an array
;; of unique integers, determine if it is possible to sort the array by
;; swapping two elements of the array. For instance, the array
;; [1,2,6,4,5,3,7] can be sorted by swapping 3 and 6, but there is no
;; way to sort the array [5,4,3,2,1] by swapping two of its elements.
;; You may use O(n) time, where the array has n integers, and constant
;; additional space. Your task is to write a program that determines if
;; an array can be sorted with a single swap. When you are finished, you
;; are welcome to read or run a suggested solution, or to post your own
;; solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.

;; Odd Appearances
;; 
;; Today’s exercise is the kind of interview question that I don’t
;; like. If you know the trick, you look like a genius, and if you don’t
;; know the trick, you don’t get the job:
;; 
;; In an unsorted array of integers, find the one integer that appears an
;; odd number of times. You may use O(n) time and O(1) space. For
;; instance, in the array [4, 3, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3], the number 2
;; appears 2 times, the number 3 appears 4 times, the number 4 appears 3
;; times, and the number 6 appears 2 times, so the correct answer is 4.
;; 
;; Your task is to write a program to find the integer that appears an
;; odd number of times.

'(4 3 6 2 6 4 2 3 4 3 3)
